# Business Connect
**Business Connect** is a social media app for CEO community where CEOs are users who can connect to each other through this platform.
Users can follow each other based on their interests, see their posts and communicate through a Live Chat feature.

**Business Connect** is a Full-Stack Website fully designed and developed by me. The data is provided by an external API, Random User API. To develop the website, I used the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) with Socket.IO.
